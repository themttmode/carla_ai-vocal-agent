# Upfirst marketing site (static copy)

This repository contains a static, single-page marketing site inspired by [upfirst.ai](https://upfirst.ai). The page is built with semantic HTML, inline CSS and a small amount of vanilla JavaScript for scroll-triggered animations and FAQ toggles.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` directly in your browser to view the experience locally. No build tools or external dependencies beyond Google Fonts are required.

## Key sections

- Responsive hero with animated metrics and conversational call mockups
- Feature breakdown, platform workflow and industry use cases
- Testimonials, pricing comparison and FAQ accordion
- Call-to-action and footer with quick links

Feel free to customize the content or styles to better fit your brand.
